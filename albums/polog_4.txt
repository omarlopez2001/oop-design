[Chorus]
Talk slick, he a dead man
Shots from the FN sprayin'
These days, they don't give a fuck
They'll shoot where the kids playin'
Judge tryna give 'em life so them gang signs turn to prayer hands
I come from a dark place, I'll never be there again
Double G's on everything, Gucci my headband
Keep smokin' these dead niggas, I feel like Redman
Pourin' lean up out my cup, runnin' through these bucks for my dead friends
Capalot bought guns for the hood, heard that's what the feds sayin'

[Verse 1]
My life a movie, ever since birth, it's been lights, camera, action
I did a lot of shit in these streets but only got booked for trappin'
I'm from Chicago, where it's normal to hear .40's clappin'
All you hear is them shots let off, that door slam, and them tires scratchin'
Rollie on my wrist, gotta get more rich, I want that brand new Patek
I ball like AI, this shit effortless, don't give a fuck 'bout practice
Where I'm from we all on that car
If he drive too fast, we gon' let him have it
Opposition wanna kill me, and I'll be damned if I let it happen
And the day I leave this earth, I'ma die with legend status
I'ma reunite with my demons, we gon' be in Heaven cappin'
Hundred K on VVS, just to show I'm blessed from rappin'
I keep this glizzy tucked if they plan on necklace snatchin'

[Chorus]
Talk slick, he a dead man
Shots from the FN sprayin'
These days, they don't give a fuck
They'll shoot where the kids playin'
Judge tryna give 'em life so them gang signs turn to prayer hands
I come from a dark place, I'll never be there again
Double G's on everything, Gucci my headband
Keep smokin' these dead niggas, I feel like Redman
Pourin' lean up out my cup, runnin' through these bucks for my dead friends
Capalot bought guns for the hood, heard that's what the feds sayin'

[Verse 2]
My shoes from Germany, like James Harden, Euro step on the scene
Double G's, new Margiela, Alexander McQueen
And you know that bag on me, it's at least fifty bands in them jeans
Pockets fat and my jewelry dancing
Diamonds flooded like New Orleans
Lavish life, now I live like a king
I got on, now I'm blessing my team
Told my brother, "I got your back"
Show my niggas what loyalty means
But this shit wasn't as easy as it seems
My homie died at 16
I remember I was up all night
Kept seeing death in my dreams
I was posted on Sed with them fiends
Hot and 'em got the TEC with the stream
Laser tag, we was playin' with them beams
Young nigga tryna kill everything
Touch his soul in this four nickel ring
It's a whole lot of shots flying in your FaceTime when that Smith & Wesson ring (Ayy)

[Chorus]
Talk slick, he a dead man
Shots from the FN sprayin'
These days, they don't give a fuck
They'll shoot where the kids playin'
Judge tryna give 'em life so them gang signs turn to prayer hands
I come from a dark place, I'll never be there again
Double G's on everything, Gucci my headband
Keep smokin' these dead niggas, I feel like Redman
Pourin' lean up out my cup, runnin' through these bucks for my dead friends
Capalot bought guns for the hood, heard that's what the feds sayin'
